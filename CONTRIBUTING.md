# Contributing to Our Project

First off, thank you for considering contributing! It's people like you that make this project great. We welcome any type of contribution, not just code.

This document is a guide to help you through the process of contributing.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, from improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, or writing code which can be incorporated into the project itself.

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please first check our issue tracker to see if it has already been reported. If not, please file a new issue.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please open an issue to discuss it. This allows us to coordinate our efforts and prevent duplication of work.

Provide a clear description of the enhancement and why you think it would be valuable.

### Submitting Pull Requests

If you'd like to contribute code, that's fantastic! Here’s how you can do it:

1.  **Fork the repository** and clone it to your local machine.
2.  **Set up your development environment**. Follow the `Getting Started` guide in the `README.md`
3.  **Add or update tests**.  Run the test suite to make sure everything is still working. Add or update tests as needed.
```bash
make test_container
```
4.  **Update documentation**. If you've added a new feature or changed an existing one, please update the relevant documentation (e.g., `README.md`).
5.  **Commit your changes**. Please write a clear, concise commit message. We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.
6.  **Open a Pull Request** to the `main` branch of the original repository. Provide a clear description of the changes you've made.

## Pull Request Guidelines

*   The PR title should be descriptive.
*   The PR description should explain the "what" and "why" of the changes.
*   Ensure all automated checks are passing.
*   If your PR addresses an open issue, please link it in the description (e.g., `Closes #123`).
*   Be prepared to address feedback from the maintainers.
